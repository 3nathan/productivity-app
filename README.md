## What is this app?

I'm not sure what this app will become yet.
I want an easy to access terminal based app to easily see details of tasks.
I imagine it as a sort of high power terminal based reminder app.

"Why are you making your own app for this?", I hear you asking.

Well there isn't really a good answer. For fun, and because using terminal based apps looks kinda cool.

## Potential extensions

 - Interface with an AWS instance to share data between different machines.
 - Develop smartphone app that also interfaces with AWS instance.
